h1. Dart (pure)

Dart is a tiny personal IRC bot.

*The "pure" branch uses pure Ruby code to define commands.*

Unlike most bots, the only functionality Dart comes with is the ability to connect to a server. It's up to you to add commands using Ruby.

h2. Requirements

You'll need the "summer":http://github.com/radar/summer gem, which is an ultra-lightweight IRC framework.

h2. Configuration

To configure Dart, copy <tt>config/summer.example.yml</tt> to <tt>config/summer.yml</tt>.

Tell Dart where to connect using @server@, @nick@ and @channels@.

@owner@ will be inserted into the regular expression @/^owner$/i@ and should match any hostmasks (e.g. "Wheaties!wheaties@example.com") Dart should respond to. Remove @owner@ to have Dart respond to anyone.

@commands@ is a hash of command names and associated Ruby code. You may use YAML's _&anchors_ and _*references_ to create "aliases" for your commands.

h2. Usage

Tell Dart to execute a command by addressing him in IRC:

<pre><Wheaties> dart: echo my hovercraft is full of eels
<dart> my hovercraft is full of eels</pre>
